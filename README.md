### Stunning MultiSteps-Form.

Multi Step Form with Step Progress Bar using HTML CSS & JavaScript.

This form is long-form and it has broken into four steps. In each step, there are questions which user needs to enter. And I’ve also added a step progress bar on the top of the Form which indicates steps. There are two buttons (Next and Previous) on each step. When you click on the next button it’ll redirect you to the next step and when you click on the previous button it’ll redirect you to the previous step.
